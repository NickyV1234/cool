# MY ART EXPERIENCE 
ever since i was in highschool I have been working on tuning my skill with art that I have had ever since I was young. I took numorous art classes in highschool as well as in college. My strong suit with physical art definitely comes from my ability to work with graphite. here are some of the images I have drawn with it
