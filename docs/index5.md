The two texts that I analyzed were Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre and Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights. The tool that I used was Antconc. As for the settings I set it to clusters and ngrams with a min of 2 and a max of 4. So the first conclusion that I came to when analyzing these two texts is that they really dont have that many specific phrases in common. the only phrases both passages have are very common and run of the mill comnbinations of words. But the very frequent phrases that both of the stories held were very intensive with third person and first person words "you, I, me, Him, Her, and he" in particular. I found this to be very interesting. But as for the rest of the phrases. that ant conc was able to find, they were phrases that only belonged to one article
