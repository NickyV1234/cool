For this Project I was required to make two sites. One on github and another on wordpress or sites.psu.edu. for my second website i decided to use sites.psu.edu. 
Right off the bat I would like to point out the stoic contrast between making a site on github and psu sites. github allows a little bit more freedom with designing a 
website and you are limited only by your knowledge of code where as on sites.psu you have to follow what they give you for making a site. over all I enjoyed making a site on 
github more than on penn state sites. it was much more of a test to my creativity than the psu sites. here is the link to my psu site
